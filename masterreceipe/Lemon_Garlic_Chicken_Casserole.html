            <li>Here are some of the health benefits of Lemon-Garlic Chicken Casserole :</li>
            <ul class=>
                <li>Lemon chicken contains lemon juice, which is a rich source of vitamin C. Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that helps boost immunity, protect against free radicals, and promote healthy skin. Including lemon chicken in your diet can contribute to your daily vitamin C intake.</li>
                <li>If you’re watching your fat intake, lemon chicken is a great option. It is typically prepared using lean chicken breast and minimal added fats, making it a low-fat protein choice. This can be beneficial for those looking to maintain a healthy weight or reduce their overall fat consumption.</li>
                <li>For those following a low-carbohydrate diet, lemon chicken can be a suitable choice. It is relatively low in carbohydrates compared to other popular chicken dishes like breaded or fried varieties. This makes lemon chicken a favorable option for individuals watching their carb intake.</li>

            <li><h3> How to make Lemon-Garlic Chicken Casserole</h3></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Place chicken, lemon zest, lemon juice, garlic and thyme in a large zip-top plastic bag or bowl. Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Remove chicken from marinade; reserve marinade.</li>
                <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large high-sided oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken; cook until browned on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.</li>
                <li>Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the drippings in the pan; reduce heat to medium. Add shallot; cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add rice; cook, stirring constantly, until lightly toasted, about 1 minute. Add broth and milk, stirring to combine. Stir in Parmesan rind (if using), salt and pepper; bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Stir in the chicken and the reserved marinade. Cover, transfer to the oven and bake until the liquid is mostly absorbed, about 45 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the skillet from the oven. Sprinkle evenly with broccoli florets. Bake, covered, until the rice and broccoli are tender, about 10 minutes. Top with Parmesan. Garnish with lemon zest and thyme leaves, if desired.</li>
