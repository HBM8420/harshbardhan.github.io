            <li>Here are some of the health benefits of Strawberry-Pineapple Smoothie :</li>
            <ul class=>
                <li>One cup of strawberries contains around 120% of the daily value of vitamin C (84 mg of vitamin C). This important vitamin is a strong antioxidant that protects the body from damage caused by free radicals.</li>
                <li>Vitamin C is also needed for good skin and connective tissue maintenance. It helps the body generate collagen, the protein responsible for the suppleness of the skin.</li>
                <li>In addition to being a rich source of antioxidants, strawberries are also packed with fiber, which is essential for digestive health and helps us maintain the feeling of satiation after a meal (2.9 g of fiber in one cup of strawberries).</li>
